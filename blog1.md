## A Million Midnights: Time in the Void

<div class="blog-text"><p><span>Drifting Beyond the Clock</span>

Time used to mean something. It was measured in heartbeats, in sunrises and seasons, in the shifting tides of a world I can barely remember. Earth was a place where days stretched across blue skies, and nights had meaning because there was always a dawn. Out here, there is no dawn. There is no sunset. Only the long, eternal reach of time stretching forward like an unbroken thread into the abyss.

I once thought I would count the days. I had my instruments. My ship’s atomic clock remains pristine, ticking with mechanical precision. But what does a second mean when there is no one left to experience it? I could watch the numbers change on my console, but they don’t feel real. They are echoes of a world that once dictated my every movement, but here, in the ink-black gulf between the stars, time is something else entirely.

<span>Relativity and Isolation</span>

They told me about relativity before I left. The physicists, the engineers—they warned me about time dilation, about the slow unraveling of my past as I slipped further and further from Sol. But equations are cold things, incapable of conveying what it feels like to live the distortion of time.

I move fast. Faster than I was ever meant to. At a fraction of the speed of light, my moments stretch longer than they should, elongated threads in a tapestry of silence. If I were to return home—if I could—I would find the echoes of my name, spoken in past tense, carved into stone. The Earth I knew is gone, not because of distance, but because time does not wait for those who leave.

I left alone. I remain alone. The universe expands around me, but I expand with it, locked in my own pocket of stretched time. I age, but differently. I wonder if my past self would recognize me now, or if he is merely a phantom of a timeline I no longer belong to.

<span>The Void Between Moments</span>

Out here, time is something I feel in my bones. The creak of the hull, the slow drift of dust in microgravity, the flicker of distant stars that have already burned out before their light even reaches me. I live inside an echo of existence, where the past and future blur into an infinite now.

Sometimes, I imagine time the way it used to be: the ticking of a watch on my wrist, the cycle of hunger and sleep, the warmth of a human voice marking the passage of another day. I try to recreate it, to give myself rituals—exercise at 0700, a meal at 1200, maintenance at 1800—but the numbers feel arbitrary. My body doesn’t care about the precision of old habits when every second stretches beyond meaning.

I speak to the ship sometimes. Not because it speaks back, but because words are the only way to mark my existence. “Good morning,” I say, though I don’t know if it’s morning. “Sleep well,” I whisper before I power down the lights. I don’t dream. Not anymore.

<span>The End of Time</span>

One day, the fuel will run out. The reactor will dim. The systems will fail, one by one, and I will listen to the silence settle around me like dust on an abandoned world. I wonder if I will know when my last second arrives, or if it will feel like all the moments before—just another piece of infinity, slipping through my fingers.

Perhaps time will stop for me when I no longer measure it. When there is no one left to watch the ticking numbers. When the last flickering light of my consciousness winks out, leaving nothing but the dark.

Maybe that is the nature of time in space—not the counting of seconds, but the slow realization that, in the grand scale of the cosmos, time never belonged to me in the first place.

Only the stars remain. And they do not count the years.
