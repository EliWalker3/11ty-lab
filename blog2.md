## Time in Space: A Guide to Losing All Sense of Reality

<div class="blog-text"><p>Listen, I used to think time was pretty straightforward. You wake up, drink coffee, go to work, complain about work, go home, watch TV, and repeat until retirement or the heat death of the universe—whichever comes first. But then I went to space, and let me tell you: time is a lie.

First of all, there’s no day or night. The sun doesn’t “rise” when you’re hurtling through the void at absurd speeds. I tried keeping track of time using my ship’s clock, but it turns out staring at a screen that just says 02:37:14 for what feels like eternity is bad for mental health.

Also, relativity? Rude. I move fast, which means my time moves slow compared to everyone else. That’s great if you hate aging, but it also means by the time I get home, my favorite TV show will have been canceled, rebooted, and canceled again. (I swear, if they ruin Firefly a second time, I will personally turn this ship around.)

The worst part? I tried to implement structure. “Wake up at 7 AM,” I told myself. But what is 7 AM in deep space? I have no sun. No annoying alarm clock. Just the cold, indifferent silence of the cosmos. Now I just sleep whenever my body gives up and eat when I get bored.

Long story short: Time in space is like dieting. You tell yourself you have a plan, but before you know it, you’re eating spaghetti at 3 AM, questioning all your life choices.

Anyway, if anyone from Earth reads this in 100 years—please send snacks.</p></div>
